## BOM

| Qty | Description | Price | Link |
|-----|-------------|-------|------|
| 1 | Raspberry Pi (4B / 5 / Zero 2W) | ~$35–80 | [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/) |
| 1 | Micro SD Card (≥32 GB) | ~$10 | [Amazon](https://a.co/d/08aiL8c) |
| 1 | USB lavalier microphone | $14.99 | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0176NRE1G) |
| 1 | Pi power supply | ~$10 | — |

Optional: a [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) (free tier covers a regional regen) for restyling or adding species, and an [eBird API key](https://ebird.org/api/keygen) for filtering the species list to your area.

---

## 1. Flash the SD card

Use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). Pick **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)**. In the customisation dialog, set:

- Username (your choice — the installer uses whatever you pick)
- WiFi SSID + password
- Hostname: `birdnet` (so it's reachable at `birdnet.local`)
- Enable SSH with password auth

Plug the USB lavalier mic into the Pi, place the capsule in a window or mount it outside under an eave, and boot.

---

## 2. Run the installer

SSH in and run one command:

```bash
ssh <your-username>@birdnet.local
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Twarner491/AvianVisitors/avian-visitors/newinstaller.sh | bash
```

The installer clones this fork, sets up BirdNET-Pi (audio capture, model, web UI), and symlinks the AvianVisitors overlay into the Caddy web root. Takes 20–40 minutes. The Pi reboots when done.

Open `http://birdnet.local/avian/` from any device on your network. The BirdNET-Pi stock UI sits at `http://birdnet.local/`.

## 3. (Optional) Restyle the illustrations

The repo ships with 450 bundled illustrations covering most North-American species. To change the visual style or add region-specific birds:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your-gemini-key'

# Re-render every species in BirdNET-Pi's model:
python3 ~/BirdNET-Pi/avian/scripts/pregen.py --labels ~/BirdNET-Pi/model/labels.txt --force

# Or only species eBird has observed in your region:
export EBIRD_API_KEY='your-ebird-key'
python3 ~/BirdNET-Pi/avian/scripts/pregen.py \
  --labels ~/BirdNET-Pi/model/labels.txt \
  --ebird-region US-CA       # state, or US-CA-085 for a county
```

Style is a single editable file at [`avian/scripts/prompt.template.md`](avian/scripts/prompt.template.md). Replace the body, re-run pregen with `--force`, done.

---

## 4. (Optional) Forward off your LAN

See [`avian/forwarding/`](avian/forwarding/) for three independent recipes:

- **Cloudflare Tunnel** — public HTTPS URL, no port forwarding, optional Cloudflare Access password gate.
- **Home Assistant REST sensor** — surfaces the latest detection for automations.
- **MQTT bridge** — publishes every new detection as JSON.
